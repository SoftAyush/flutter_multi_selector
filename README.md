# flutter_multi_selector

It is a powerful Flutter package that provides an intuitive multi-selection
dialog with advanced customization options. Beyond standard features like search, select-all, and
checkbox/chip selection styles, it offers dynamic item separationâ€”automatically grouping selected
items at the top for better visibilityâ€”and per-item theming, allowing different colors and styles
for each option. The widget supports responsive sizing, ensuring optimal display on any device, and
includes built-in accessibility for screen readers. With flexible callbacks and seamless state
management, it integrates effortlessly into any app, making it perfect for complex filtering,
preference selection, or multi-choice forms while maintaining a polished, user-friendly interface.

### Disclaimer

The `flutter_multi_selector` package only supports:

Dart SDK: `^3.7.0` (minimum required)

## Usage

### MultiSelectorDialogField

This widget shows a button that opens a multi-select dialog. It integrates with Flutter forms and
allows selecting multiple items with optional search and select-all.

```dart
MultiSelectorDialogField
(
items: animals.map((animal) => MultiSelectorItem(value: animal, label: animal)).toList(),
initialValue: _selectedAnimals,
validator: (values) {
if (values == null || values.isEmpty) {
return "Please select at least one item";
}
return null;
},
autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.onUserInteraction,
buttonText: const Text("Select Animals"),
onConfirm: (values) {
setState(() {
_selectedAnimals = values;
});
},
searchable: true,
showSelectAll: true,
fieldShape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
side: const BorderSide(color: Colors.

)

)

)
,
```

### Validation and Submission

You can use a `GlobalKey<FormState>` to validate selections and trigger actions on submit:

```dart

final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

ElevatedButton
(
onPressed: () {
if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
SnackBar(content: Text("Selected Animals: $_selectedAnimals")),
);
}
},
child: const Text("Submit Form"),
)
,

```
