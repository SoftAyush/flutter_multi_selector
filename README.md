It is a powerful Flutter package that provides an intuitive multi-selection
dialog with advanced customization options. Beyond standard features like search, select-all, and
checkbox/chip selection styles, it offers dynamic item separation‚Äîautomatically grouping selected
items at the top for better visibility‚Äîand per-item theming, allowing different colors and styles
for each option. The widget supports responsive sizing, ensuring optimal display on any device, and
includes built-in accessibility for screen readers. With flexible callbacks and seamless state
management, it integrates effortlessly into any app, making it perfect for complex filtering,
preference selection, or multi-choice forms while maintaining a polished, user-friendly interface.

### MultiSelectorDialogField

This widget shows a button that opens a multi-select dialog. It integrates with Flutter forms and
allows selecting multiple items with optional search and select-all.

```
MultiSelectorDialogField(
  items: animals
      .map((animal) => MultiSelectorItem(value: animal, label: animal))
      .toList(),
  initialValue: _selectedAnimals,
  validator: (values) {
    if (values == null || values.isEmpty) {
      return "Please select at least one item";
    }
    return null;
  },
  autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.onUserInteraction,
  buttonText: const Text("Select Animals"),
  onConfirm: (values) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedAnimals = values;
    });
  },
  searchable: true,
  showSelectAll: true,
  fieldShape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
    side: const BorderSide(color: Colors.grey),
  ),
)
```

### Validation and Submission

You can use a `GlobalKey<FormState>` to validate selections and trigger actions on submit:

```
final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text("Selected Animals: $_selectedAnimals")),
      );
    }
  },
  child: const Text("Submit Form"),
)

```
